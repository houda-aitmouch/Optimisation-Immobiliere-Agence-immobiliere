The primary objective was to design and develop a fully digitalized web platform tailored for a real estate agency. The project followed a systematic approach, commencing with a comprehensive functional study to discern the fundamental requirements and features of the platform. Subsequently, an in-depth conceptual study was conducted utilizing the MERISE method. This facilitated the modeling of the database structure and the coherent design of various system entities, thereby streamlining the implementation phase.
Initially, the team concentrated on creating user-friendly interfaces to facilitate property searches for both buyers and renters, while also enabling sellers to publish information about their properties. Following this, the focus shifted to back-end development, utilizing various tools to implement crucial features such as user authentication, advertisement management, and data security. Once the effectiveness of the back-end was verified, attention was redirected towards front-end development, ensuring that the digital real estate platform boasted an attractive, cohesive, and user-friendly appearance.
